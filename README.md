## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The app fetches team rosters from ESPN to identify all active quarterbacks
2. **Statistics**: Individual QB statistics are retrieved for the current season
3. **Metrics Calculation**: Five key metrics are calculated:
   - **Team Success** (45%): Win-loss record and playoff performance
   - **Individual Stats** (25%): Passing yards, TDs, completion percentage, passer rating
   - **Championship History** (15%): Super Bowl wins and playoff success
   - **Clutch Performance** (10%): Performance in key moments
   - **Team Support** (5%): Quality of supporting cast adjustment

4. **Dynamic Rankings**: Users can adjust the weight of each metric to see how rankings change
5. **Real-time Updates**: Rankings update instantly as weights are adjusted

## Customization

The weighting system allows you to customize rankings based on your QB philosophy:
- Increase **Team Success** weight if you value winning above all
- Boost **Individual Stats** for pure statistical performance
- Emphasize **Championship History** for proven winners
- Adjust **Clutch Performance** for pressure situations
- Modify **Team Support** to account for surrounding talent
